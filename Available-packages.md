## Arch Linux

Bitwarden_rs is already packaged for Archlinux thanks to @mqus. There is an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bitwarden_rs) (optionally with the [vault web interface](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bitwarden_rs-vault/) ) available.

## Debian

A docker based toolchain can be used to build debian packages: https://github.com/greizgh/bitwarden_rs-debian
It bundles the server and the web vault.


## CentOS7 / RHEL7

A RPM Repository is packaged by @MrMEEE here: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mrmeee/bitwarden_rs/ ... This also includes the webinterface in an additional package.

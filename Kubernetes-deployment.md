Please check the [kubernetes-bitwarden_rs](https://github.com/icicimov/kubernetes-bitwarden_rs) repository for example deployment in Kubernetes.
It will setup a fully functional and secure `bitwarden_rs` application in Kubernetes behind [nginx-ingress-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) and AWS [ELBv1](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/#Details_for_Elastic_Load_Balancing_Products). It provides little bit more than just simple deployment but you can use all or just part of the manifests depending on your needs and setup.
